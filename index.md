# MiHoCode
In this place you will find the results of my hobby projects in the future, in the hope that you can make something beautiful out of it.

I am a civil engineer, software developer and passionate tinkerer. I like to experiment with Arduinos and Raspberries.
Professionally, I work mainly in the .NET environment and build database-driven web applications and mobile apps.
