# MiHoCode
In this place you will find the results of my hobby projects in the future, in the hope that you can make something beautiful out of it.

I am a civil engineer, software developer and passionate tinkerer. I like to experiment with Arduinos and Raspberries.
Professionally, I work mainly in the .NET environment and build database-driven web applications and mobile apps.

### IoT Data Messaging System
This messaging system consists of several applications / components that enable messages (data) to be sent and received across different networks. This is intended in particular for the communication of different devices from the IoT context. There is a server (broker) that can be reached via the Internet. In the local network, a Node can run as a local intermediary to which the devices connect.
The broker and node applications are available for download and can be used directly without programming.
